# Task Estimation

## User Stories
{user_stories}

## Complexity Factors
{complexity_factors}

## Estimation Methodology
### Story Points Scale: Modified Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
### Factors Considered:
- Technical complexity
- Business complexity
- Risk and uncertainty
- Effort required

## Story Estimations
### Small Stories (1-3 points)
- Simple UI changes
- Basic CRUD operations
- Straightforward integrations

### Medium Stories (5-8 points)
- Complex business logic
- Multiple system integrations
- Advanced UI components

### Large Stories (13-21 points)
- Complex algorithms
- Major architectural changes
- High uncertainty items

## Estimation Confidence
- High confidence: Well-understood requirements
- Medium confidence: Some unknowns
- Low confidence: Significant unknowns requiring spikes

- Average velocity: Target points per sprint

### Velocity Trends
- Increasing: Team learning and process improvement
- Stable: Predictable delivery capacity
- Decreasing: Potential impediments or complexity increases

## Capacity Planning
### Team Availability
- Development days per sprint
- Holiday and vacation adjustments
- Training and meeting overhead

### Delivery Projections
- Remaining story points
- Projected completion dates
- Risk factors and buffers
