# Task 3: Collaborative Workflow Design

## Objective
Design and implement a collaborative workflow where the six agents work together to refine product initiative documents through structured interaction and feedback loops.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Sequential Task Flow Design**
  - Define the order in which agents contribute to PID refinement
  - Establish handoff points between agents
  - Create clear inputs and outputs for each agent in the workflow
  
- [ ] **Collaborative Task Design**
  - Design tasks that allow agents to build on each other's work
  - Create tasks that require multiple agents to collaborate
  - Establish review and feedback mechanisms between agents
  
- [ ] **Feedback Loop Implementation**
  - Design iteration cycles where agents can refine their work based on feedback
  - Implement maximum 5 iterations per PID as specified in acceptance criteria
  - Create exit criteria for each iteration to prevent endless loops
  
- [ ] **Task Dependencies and Orchestration**
  - Map dependencies between different agent tasks
  - Implement proper task sequencing and parallel execution where appropriate
  - Design rollback mechanisms for failed iterations

## Workflow Stages
1. **Discovery Phase** (Product Manager + Market Analyst)
   - Market opportunity assessment
   - Problem validation and refinement
   - Initial business case development
   
2. **Solution Design Phase** (Engineering Manager + Product Designer)
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - User experience design
   - Architecture and implementation planning
   
3. **Breakdown Phase** (Functional Analyst + Scrum Master)
   - Requirements decomposition
   - Task breakdown and estimation
   - Sprint planning and velocity assessment
   
4. **Review and Iteration Phase** (All Agents)
   - Cross-functional review
   - Feedback integration
   - Iteration decision making

## Implementation Details
- Replace current placeholder task with comprehensive task workflow
- Implement in `product_crew/crew/tasks.py` and `product_crew/crew/runner.py`
- Create task templates for each workflow stage
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Add progress tracking and logging throughout the workflow

## Definition of Done
- Complete workflow is implemented with all six agents participating
- Clear task dependencies and sequencing is established
- Feedback loops are functional with proper iteration control
- All workflow stages produce structured outputs
- Integration tests validate the full workflow end-to-end
- Documentation explains the workflow design and agent interactions
