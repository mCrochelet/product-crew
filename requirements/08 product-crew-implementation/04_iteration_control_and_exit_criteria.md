# Task 4: Iteration Control and Exit Criteria

## Objective
Implement robust iteration control mechanisms with clear exit criteria to ensure the collaborative workflow converges on high-quality outputs within the maximum 5 iterations per PID.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Iteration Counter Implementation**
  - Track current iteration number for each PID refinement process
  - Enforce maximum 5 iterations as specified in requirements
  - Provide clear feedback about iteration progress to users
  
- [ ] **Quality-Based Exit Criteria**
  - Define objective quality metrics for PID refinement completion
  - Implement automated quality assessment for each workflow stage
  - Create scoring system for completeness and coherence of outputs
  
- [ ] **Consensus-Based Exit Criteria**
  - Implement agent consensus mechanisms for iteration completion
  - Create voting system for agents to indicate satisfaction with current state
  - Define minimum consensus threshold for workflow completion
  
- [ ] **Time-Based Exit Criteria**
  - Implement maximum execution time limits per iteration
  - Add timeout mechanisms to prevent stuck iterations
  - Provide graceful degradation when time limits are reached
  
- [ ] **Error Recovery and Fallback**
  - Handle cases where iterations fail or produce invalid outputs
  - Implement rollback mechanisms to previous valid states
  - Provide fallback strategies when maximum iterations are reached without convergence

## Quality Metrics
- **Completeness Score**: Percentage of required PID sections that are properly filled
- **Coherence Score**: Consistency between different agent contributions
- **Feasibility Score**: Alignment between business goals and technical constraints
- **Clarity Score**: Readability and specificity of requirements and tasks
- **Market Validation Score**: Quality of market research and validation evidence

## Implementation Details
- Add iteration tracking to `product_crew/crew/runner.py`
- Implement quality assessment functions in `product_crew/crew/evaluation.py`
- Create consensus mechanisms in agent task definitions
- Add timeout and error handling throughout the workflow
- Implement state persistence for rollback capabilities

## Exit Conditions (OR logic - any condition triggers exit)
1. **Quality Threshold Met**: All quality metrics above defined thresholds
2. **Agent Consensus**: Majority of agents vote for completion
3. **Maximum Iterations**: 5 iterations completed regardless of quality
4. **Timeout Reached**: Maximum execution time exceeded
5. **Error Threshold**: Too many errors encountered in current iteration

## Definition of Done
- All exit criteria are implemented and functional
- Maximum 5 iterations constraint is enforced
- Quality metrics provide meaningful assessment of PID refinement
- Consensus mechanisms work reliably across different scenarios
- Error handling prevents infinite loops and provides graceful degradation
- Comprehensive logging of iteration decisions and exit reasons
- Tests validate all exit conditions work as expected
