# Task 5: PID Output Structure and Formatting

## Objective
Define and implement a comprehensive Product Initiative Document (PID) output structure that incorporates contributions from all six agents in a coherent, well-organized format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Standardized PID Template**
  - Define comprehensive sections for each agent's contributions
  - Create markdown template with clear section headers and formatting
  - Ensure template accommodates iterative refinement and updates
  
- [ ] **Agent-Specific Sections**
  - Product Manager sections: Executive Summary, Business Case, Success Metrics
  - Engineering Manager sections: Technical Architecture, Implementation Plan, Risk Assessment
  - Product Designer sections: User Experience, Design Requirements, Interaction Flows
  - Functional Analyst sections: Functional Requirements, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria
  - Scrum Master sections: Sprint Breakdown, Task Estimation, Delivery Timeline
  - Market Analyst sections: Market Research, Competitive Analysis, Validation Plan
  
- [ ] **Cross-Functional Integration Sections**
  - Dependencies and Integration Points
  - Risk Mitigation Strategies
  - Success Metrics and KPIs
  - Resource Requirements and Timeline
  
- [ ] **Version Control and Iteration Tracking**
  - Document version history with iteration markers
  - Change log showing which agents contributed in each iteration
  - Consensus indicators and quality scores per section

- Implement section-specific formatting helpers
- Add agent attribution and contribution tracking
- Create validation for required sections and content quality
- Implement diff tracking between iterations

## Definition of Done
- Complete PID template is implemented and generates well-formatted documents
- All six agents can contribute to their designated sections
- Cross-functional sections properly integrate multi-agent inputs
- Version control and iteration tracking work reliably
- Generated PIDs are readable and professional
- Template validation ensures all required sections are present
- Tests verify PID generation with various input scenarios
