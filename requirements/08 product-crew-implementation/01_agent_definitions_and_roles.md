- Set appropriate `max_iter` and `max_execution_time` parameters

## Definition of Done
- All six agents are properly defined in `product_crew/crew/agents.py`
- Each agent has a clear, unique role that doesn't overlap with others
- Agent definitions follow CrewAI documentation and best practices
- Agents are configured for collaborative workflow
- Unit tests exist for each agent creation function
