# Task 7: Demo Mode Enhancement

## Objective
Enhance the existing demo mode to provide detailed visualization and interaction capabilities for the full product crew collaborative workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Agent-by-Agent Visualization**
  - Show each agent's role, current task, and progress
  - Display agent thinking process and decision making
  - Visualize agent interactions and handoffs
  - Show tool usage and outcomes for each agent
  
- [ ] **Iteration Tracking Visualization**
  - Display current iteration number and progress
  - Show iteration history and changes between iterations
  - Visualize convergence progress and quality improvements
  - Display exit criteria evaluation in real-time
  
- [ ] **Interactive Workflow Control**
  - Allow users to pause and resume workflow at any stage
  - Enable step-by-step execution with user approval
  - Provide option to intervene or provide additional guidance
  - Allow users to inspect intermediate outputs and agent reasoning
  
- [ ] **Quality Metrics Dashboard**
  - Real-time display of quality scores and metrics
  - Visual indicators for completion status of each PID section
  - Progress bars for overall workflow completion
  - Consensus indicators showing agent agreement levels
  
- [ ] **Debugging and Troubleshooting Features**
  - Detailed logging display with filtering capabilities
  - Agent communication logs and message passing
  - Error tracking and resolution suggestions
  - Performance metrics and timing information

## Implementation Details
- Enhance existing demo mode in `product_crew/demo/utilities.py`
- Add new visualization functions for agent collaboration
- Implement interactive controls and user input handling
- Create quality metrics dashboard with real-time updates
- Add logging and debugging display capabilities

## Interactive Commands
- `ENTER`: Continue to next step
- `P`: Pause execution and wait for user input
- `I`: Inspect current agent outputs and reasoning
- `S`: Skip current agent (for testing purposes)
- `Q`: Quit demo mode and return to normal execution
- `H`: Show help and available commands
- `L`: Toggle detailed logging display
- `M`: Show quality metrics dashboard

## Definition of Done
- Enhanced demo mode provides comprehensive workflow visualization
- All interactive commands work reliably
- Quality metrics and progress tracking display accurately
- Agent collaboration and handoffs are clearly visualized
- Users can understand the full workflow through demo mode
- Performance impact of demo mode is minimal
- Demo mode works with both OpenAI and Anthropic models
- Documentation explains all demo mode features and commands
