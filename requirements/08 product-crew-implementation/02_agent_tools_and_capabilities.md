## Implementation Details
- Create custom tools in `product_crew/crew/tools/` directory
- Each tool should be a Python function with clear input/output specifications
- Tools should integrate with existing PID structure and requirements folder
- Implement proper error handling and validation for each tool
- Tools should be able to read from and write to markdown files
- Consider using existing libraries for specific functionality (e.g., market research APIs)

## Technical Requirements
- Tools should follow CrewAI tool patterns and decorators
- Each tool should have comprehensive docstrings
- Tools should be testable in isolation
- Input validation and error handling for all tools
- Logging for tool usage and outcomes

## Definition of Done
- All agent-specific tools are implemented and functional
- Tools are properly integrated with their respective agents
- Tools can read from requirements folder and PID files
- Tools can generate structured output for other agents to consume
- Comprehensive test coverage for all tools
- Documentation for each tool's purpose and usage
