# Task 03: Create Phase-Specific Product Manager Tasks

## Objective
Implement individual task creation functions for each of the 7 lifecycle phases with appropriate delegation logic.

## Phase Task Functions

### Phase 1: Understanding Task
- `create_problem_understanding_task()`
- Analyzes existing data completeness
- Conditionally delegates to Market Analyst
- Creates problem context section in PID

### Phase 2: Definition Task
- `create_problem_definition_task()`
- Defines problem statement and domain
- Conditionally delegates to Market Analyst + Functional Analyst
- Creates problem definition section in PID

### Phase 3: Ideation Task
- `create_solution_ideation_task()`
- Delegates to all available agents
- Generates multiple solution options
- Documents all solutions in PID

### Phase 4: Validation Task
- `create_solution_validation_task()`
- Evaluates solutions on 4 dimensions:
  - Value (jobs-to-be-done, user impact)
  - Viability (revenue vs cost analysis)  
  - Feasibility (technical + legal constraints)
  - Usability (user experience evaluation)
- Creates validation matrix in PID

### Phase 5: Refinement Task
- `create_solution_refinement_task()`
- Delegates to Designer, Functional Analyst, Engineering Manager
- Improves solutions based on validation feedback
- Updates PID with refined solutions

### Phase 6: Selection Task
- `create_solution_selection_task()`
- Product Manager synthesizes insights
- Applies selection criteria
- Documents decision rationale in PID

### Phase 7: Planning Task
- `create_implementation_planning_task()`
- Delegates to Functional Analyst, Scrum Master, Engineering Manager
- Creates detailed implementation plan
- Documents roadmap and tasks in PID

## Implementation Details
- Each task has clear inputs/outputs
- Delegation conditions are explicitly coded
- PID sections are structured and consistent
- Error handling for incomplete delegations

## Success Criteria
- All 7 phase tasks implemented
- Delegation logic working correctly
- PID sections properly populated
- Tasks integrate seamlessly
