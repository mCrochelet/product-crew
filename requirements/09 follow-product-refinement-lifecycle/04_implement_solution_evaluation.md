# Task 04: Implement Solution Evaluation Framework

## Objective
Create a comprehensive solution evaluation system that assesses solutions across Value, Viability, Feasibility, and Usability dimensions.

## Evaluation Framework

### Value Assessment
- **User Value**: Impact on user problems and pain points
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: How well solution serves user needs
- **Market Opportunity**: Size and growth potential
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiation factors

### Viability Assessment  
- **Revenue Model**: How solution generates income
- **Cost Structure**: Development and operational costs
- **Financial Projections**: ROI and payback period
- **Business Model Fit**: Alignment with company strategy

### Feasibility Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Implementation difficulty
- **Resource Requirements**: Team skills and capacity needed
- **Timeline Constraints**: Development duration
- **Legal/Regulatory**: Compliance requirements
- **Risk Factors**: Technical and business risks

### Usability Assessment
- **User Experience**: Ease of use and intuitiveness  
- **Accessibility**: Inclusive design considerations
- **User Journey**: Flow and interaction quality
- **Design Complexity**: Interface and interaction design
