# Task 05: Create Implementation Planning Framework

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive implementation planning system that breaks down the selected solution into actionable tasks and deliverables.

## Planning Framework

### Implementation Planning Phases
1. **Requirements Breakdown** (Functional Analyst)
   - Detailed functional specifications
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Dependency identification

2. **Technical Planning** (Engineering Manager)
   - System architecture design
   - Technology stack decisions
   - Development environment setup
   - Integration requirements
   - Risk mitigation strategies

3. **Delivery Planning** (Scrum Master)
   - Sprint breakdown and sizing
   - Resource allocation and capacity planning
   - Timeline estimation and milestones
   - Team velocity considerations
   - Release planning strategy

4. **Synthesis and Coordination** (Product Manager)
   - Cross-functional alignment
   - Priority and scope decisions
   - Success metrics definition
   - Stakeholder communication plan

## Implementation Components

### Task Breakdown Structure
- Epic-level features and capabilities
- User stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Technical tasks and infrastructure work
- Testing and quality assurance activities
- Documentation and training requirements

### Timeline and Milestones
- Development phases and sprints
- Key deliverables and checkpoints
- Dependencies and critical path
- Resource availability windows
- Risk buffers and contingencies

### Resource Planning
- Team composition and skills needed
- External dependencies and partnerships
- Budget and cost estimates
- Infrastructure and tool requirements
- Training and onboarding needs

## Delegation Strategy
- **Functional Analyst**: Requirements decomposition and user story creation
- **Engineering Manager**: Technical architecture and development estimates
- **Scrum Master**: Sprint planning and delivery timeline
- **Product Manager**: Priority decisions and plan integration

## Documentation Format
- Implementation roadmap in PID
- Detailed project plan sections
- Risk register and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Resource and budget estimates

## Success Criteria
- Complete implementation plan created
- All agents contributing their expertise
- Realistic timelines and estimates
- Clear accountability and next steps
- Comprehensive PID documentation
