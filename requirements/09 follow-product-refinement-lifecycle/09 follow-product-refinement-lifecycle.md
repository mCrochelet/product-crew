# Problem to solve

The agents today are trying to solve the problem in one go without
leveraging the best practices in PID development.

# Proposed solution

The product manager agent should delegate to the other agents but be
responsible for the process followed. Specifically, the process should be:

1. Understand the problem:
    1. analyse the provided data and determine if further research is necessary;
    2. if it is, then the product manager should delegate to the market analyst
       agent.
2. Define the problem:
    1. define the problem statement and the problem domain; if the problem
       statement is not clear, then the product manager should delegate to
       the market analyst & business analyst agent.
3. ideate solutions:
    1. Using all agents available, the product manager should ideate
       solutions to the problem.
4. validate solutions:
    1. validate the solutions using the data and the problem domain. The
       engineering manager should be asked for feasibility; each solution
       should be analysed on value (user value and jtbd served), viability
       (revenue assumptions vs cost), feasibility (implementation, legal), and
       usability (user experience).
5. refine solutions:
    1. refine the solutions using the data and the problem domain. use the
       product designer, functional analyst and engineering manager agents
6. select best solution:
    1. the product manager should select the best solution, based on all
       insights collected
7. plan the implementation:
    1. the product manager, functiona analyst scrum master and engineering
       manager should plan the implementation into tasks

All research results & insights should be written clearly in the PID
All ideated solutions should be written clearly in the PID
