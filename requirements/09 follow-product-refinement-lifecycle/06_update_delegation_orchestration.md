# Task 06: Update Delegation Orchestration Logic

## Objective
Refactor the current delegation system to follow the structured 7-phase product refinement lifecycle instead of the current single-pass approach.

## Current State Analysis
- Current system uses single orchestration task
- All delegation happens simultaneously
- No structured lifecycle progression
- Missing conditional delegation logic

## Required Changes

### Product Manager Task Updates
- Replace single orchestration task with lifecycle coordinator
- Implement phase-by-phase execution logic  
- Add conditional delegation decision points
- Include solution evaluation and selection capabilities

### Workflow Engine Changes
- Sequential phase execution instead of parallel
- Phase completion criteria validation
- Inter-phase data passing and context management
- Error handling and retry logic for incomplete phases

### Agent Coordination Updates
- Phase-specific agent activation
- Context sharing between phases
- Result validation and quality checks
- PID progressive enhancement

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Execution Logic
```python
def execute_lifecycle_phase(phase_num, context, requirements_path, pid_path, model):
    """Execute a specific lifecycle phase with appropriate delegations"""
    
    # Phase-specific delegation logic
    if phase_num == 1:  # Understand Problem
        return execute_problem_understanding(context, ...)
    elif phase_num == 2:  # Define Problem
        return execute_problem_definition(context, ...)
    # ... continue for all 7 phases
```

### Conditional Delegation
- Data completeness evaluation
- Quality threshold checks
- Agent availability validation
- Delegation necessity assessment

### Context Management
- Phase results accumulation
- PID progressive building
- Inter-phase data validation
- Error state handling

## Integration Points
- Update runner.py workflow execution
- Modify task creation functions
- Enhance agent coordination logic
- Improve PID documentation structure

## Success Criteria
- 7-phase lifecycle fully implemented
- Conditional delegation working correctly
- Phase progression logic validated
- PID quality and completeness improved
- Backward compatibility maintained
