# Task 01: Analyze Product Refinement Lifecycle Requirements

## Objective
Understand the current delegation system and identify gaps compared to the required 7-phase product refinement lifecycle.

## Analysis Required

### Current State Assessment
- Review current Product Manager orchestration task
- Analyze existing delegation patterns
- Identify missing lifecycle phases
- Document current vs required workflow

### Gap Analysis
- Missing iterative validation cycles
- Lack of structured solution evaluation (value/viability/feasibility/usability)
- No solution selection decision framework
- Missing phase-specific delegation logic

### Requirements Validation
- Confirm all 7 phases are necessary
- Validate agent assignments for each phase
- Ensure PID documentation requirements are met
- Review delegation patterns and dependencies

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of lifecycle gaps
- Documented requirements for each phase
- Agent responsibility matrix created
- Foundation for implementation planning established
