# Task 02: Design Multi-Phase Delegation Workflow

## Objective
Design a structured workflow that implements the 7-phase product refinement lifecycle with proper delegation patterns.

## Design Requirements

### Phase Architecture
```
Phase 1: Understand Problem → Market Analyst (conditional)
Phase 2: Define Problem → Market Analyst + Functional Analyst (conditional)
Phase 3: Ideate Solutions → All Agents
Phase 4: Validate Solutions → Engineering Manager + Product Designer
Phase 5: Refine Solutions → Product Designer + Functional Analyst + Engineering Manager
Phase 6: Select Best Solution → Product Manager (synthesis)
Phase 7: Plan Implementation → Functional Analyst + Scrum Master + Engineering Manager
```

### Workflow Logic
- Each phase has entry/exit criteria
- Conditional delegation based on data quality/completeness
- Solution evaluation framework (Value/Viability/Feasibility/Usability)
- Iterative refinement capabilities
- PID documentation at each phase

### Decision Points
- When to delegate vs continue
- How to evaluate solution completeness
- Criteria for solution selection
- Implementation readiness validation

## Technical Implementation
- Phase-specific task creation functions
- Delegation condition evaluation logic
- Solution scoring and comparison framework
- PID section management per phase

## Success Criteria
- Complete workflow architecture documented
- Decision logic clearly defined
- Technical approach validated
- Ready for implementation
- Use best practices in multi-agent delegation and frameworks
- Each task and tool must be documented
