# Task 11: Demo Integration Testing

## Objective
Ensure demo mode functionality is properly tested and integrates seamlessly with existing features.

## Requirements
- Create tests for demo mode CLI flag functionality
- Test interactive step control with mocked input
- Verify normal mode remains unaffected by demo additions
- Test error handling and graceful exits in demo mode
- Ensure demo mode works with all existing CLI combinations

## Testing Scenarios
1. Demo flag acceptance and parsing
2. Interactive step control with simulated input
3. Graceful Ctrl+C handling
4. Demo mode with different CLI option combinations
5. Visual output formatting validation
6. Integration with existing CrewAI workflow

## Implementation Details
- Extend existing test suite in test files
- Use pytest fixtures for demo mode testing
- Mock keyboard input for automated testing
- Test CLI flag combinations
- Add integration tests for full demo workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- All demo mode features are covered by tests
- Existing tests continue to pass
- Demo mode can be tested automatically
- Error conditions are properly handled
- Test coverage maintains or improves current levels

## Files to Modify
- Test files: Add demo mode test cases
- Consider adding demo-specific test utilities
- Update existing tests if needed for compatibility
