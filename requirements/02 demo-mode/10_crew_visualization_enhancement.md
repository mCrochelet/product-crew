# Task 10: Crew Visualization Enhancement

## Objective
Enhance crew execution visibility in demo mode to show how agents interact and collaborate.

## Requirements
- Display agent information before each task execution
- Show task descriptions and expected outputs
- Visualize the flow between different agents
- Enhance CrewAI's verbose output with demo-specific formatting
- Add visual separators and progress indicators

## Implementation Details
- Extend the existing agent and task creation with demo-aware logging
- Use Click's styling features (colors, formatting) for better visualization
- Create visual separators between different execution phases
- Display agent roles, goals, and backstories in demo mode
- Show task progress and completion status

## Visualization Elements
- Agent introduction with role and goal
- Task description with clear formatting
- Progress indicators (e.g., "Step 1 of 3")
- Visual separators between sections
- Completion confirmations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Demo mode provides rich visual feedback about crew execution
- Users can understand agent roles and interactions
- Task flow is clearly visible and understandable
- Visual output is clean and professional
- Regular mode output remains unchanged

## Files to Modify
- `main.py`: Enhance crew creation and execution with demo output
- Consider creating demo utilities for consistent formatting
