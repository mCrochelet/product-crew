# Task 18: File Operations Module Extraction

## Objective
Extract file and environment handling functions into a dedicated file operations module.

## Requirements
- Create `product_crew/file_operations/` directory structure
- Move file handling functions from main.py to `file_operations/handlers.py`
- Functions to extract:
  - `load_environment()`
  - `get_output_file_path()`
  - `create_pid_file()`
- Maintain all existing functionality and error handling
- Handle Path and datetime dependencies properly

## Implementation Details
- Create `product_crew/file_operations/__init__.py` with proper exports
- Move file operation logic to `product_crew/file_operations/handlers.py`
- Ensure all imports (Path, datetime, click, sys) are included
- Maintain exact same error handling and logging behavior
- Keep file creation logic identical

## File Operation Functions
1. **`load_environment()`**: Environment variable loading from `.env.local`
2. **`get_output_file_path()`**: Timestamp-based output file path generation
3. **`create_pid_file()`**: File creation with error handling and logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- File operations work identically to current implementation
- All error messages and exit codes preserved
- Timestamp formatting remains `YYYY-MM-DD`
- File creation logging to click.echo maintained
- All existing tests pass without modification

## Files to Create/Modify
- `product_crew/file_operations/__init__.py`
- `product_crew/file_operations/handlers.py`
- Update imports in crew runner and CLI modules
