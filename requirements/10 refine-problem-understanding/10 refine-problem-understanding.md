# Problem to solve

The problem understanding phase is very light so far. 
The understanding of the problem should take into account: 
- A clear understanding of who is the user and the customer (may be the same person)
- the user job to be done
- the value for the customer (financial, time, etc.)
- the competitive landscape for that job to be done
- an understanding of success metrics if the job to be done is successful
- the service blueprint in which the problem is and how it influences the problem

It should not list any solutions or ideas but remain on the problem understanding phase.
