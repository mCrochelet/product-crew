# Problem to solve

The problem understanding phase is very light so far.
The understanding of the problem should take into account:

- A clear understanding of who is the user and the customer (may be the same
  person)
- the user job to be done
- the value for the customer (financial, time, etc.)
- the competitive landscape for that job to be done
- an understanding of success metrics if the job to be done is successful
- the service blueprint in which the problem is and how it influences the
  problem

It should not list any solutions or ideas but remain focused on the problem
understanding phase.

# Agents to use

- product manager: orchestrates the problem understanding phase and
  validates that the PID is defined enough in terms of problem understanding
- qualitative research specialist: a qualitative research specialist is able
  to define research hypotheses, the research questions, plans and
  methodology. it can also define interview kits for qualitative research.
  It never goes into quantitative research and avoids questions better
  suited in quantitative research.
- desk research agent: a desk research agent able to deeply search the web
  and summarise the information found to the level of a McKinsey senior
  business analyst.
- quantitative research agent: a quantitative research agent able to run
  methodology-backed quantitative research. It understands the needs for
  proper sample size and defined the research questions and surveys.
- Jobs-to-be-done expert: an expert in jobs-to-be-done, able to rephrase
  customer and user needs in terms of their jobs-to-be-done and to help
  refine research questions in accordance with the methodology.
- data analyst: a data analyst able to understand the data and to help
  summarise key insights from qualitative, quantitative and mixed data.

# Work streams

Each workstream describes a series of tasks necessary to refine the problem
understanding.

- Gap analysis: Analyse the provided PID problem statement and identify
  assumptions and knowledge gaps
- Gaps prioritisation: priotitise the knowledge gaps identified in the
  previous step
- Gaps analysis: analyse the identified knowledge gaps and select the ones
  we MUST fill to feel comfortable. This must be assessed by the product
  manager and leverage their expertise.
- Research plan: If gaps have been identified, create a research plan to
  fill them. the research plan must be a series of research phases
  (qualitative, quantitative, desk research) with a preference for desk
  research if it is likely to yield valuable data.
- Research design: Design & run the research by the corresponding agent
- Data analysis: Analyse the data and summarise key insights
- Problem understanding refinement: Refine the problem understanding based
  on the insights from the data analysis
