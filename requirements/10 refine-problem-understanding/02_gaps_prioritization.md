# Gaps Prioritization Task

## Objective
Prioritize the knowledge gaps identified in the gap analysis step to focus research efforts on the most critical unknowns.

## Agents Involved
- **Product Manager**: Leads prioritization decisions based on product strategy and business impact
- **Qualitative Research Specialist**: Advises on research feasibility and effort for qualitative gaps
- **Quantitative Research Agent**: Advises on research feasibility and effort for quantitative gaps
- **Desk Research Agent**: Advises on availability of existing information and research effort

## Key Activities
1. **Gap Evaluation Framework**
   - **Business Impact**: How much does this gap affect product decisions?
   - **Research Feasibility**: How easily can this gap be filled?
   - **Time Sensitivity**: How urgently do we need this information?
   - **Cost to Fill**: What resources are required to address this gap?
   - **Confidence Level**: How uncertain are our current assumptions?

2. **Prioritization Matrix**
   - Map gaps on impact vs. effort matrix
   - Identify "quick wins" (high impact, low effort)
   - Flag "money pits" (low impact, high effort)
   - Assess "strategic bets" (high impact, high effort)

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Identify gaps that must be filled before others
   - Map research sequence requirements
   - Consider parallel research opportunities

## Deliverables
- Prioritized list of knowledge gaps
- Impact vs. effort matrix visualization
- Dependency mapping for research sequence
- Rationale for prioritization decisions

## Success Criteria
- Clear prioritization with business justification
- Realistic assessment of research effort and feasibility
- Foundation set for focused gap analysis in next task
