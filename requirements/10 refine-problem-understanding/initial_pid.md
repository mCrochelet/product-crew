# Product Initiative Document - Problem Understanding Enhancement

## Problem Space

### Current Issue
The problem understanding phase in our product crew lifecycle is currently insufficient and lacks depth. This creates downstream issues in solution development and implementation planning.

### Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Product Managers using the product-crew system
- **Secondary**: Engineering teams, designers, and analysts who depend on clear problem definitions
- **Users**: End users whose problems aren't being properly understood before solutions are developed

### Initial Problem Statement
Our current problem understanding phase fails to capture essential elements needed for effective product development, leading to solutions that may not address the real user needs or market opportunities.

## Current Approach Limitations
- Superficial analysis without deep user understanding
- Missing competitive landscape assessment  
- Lack of clear success metrics definition

- Insufficient value proposition clarity

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive user and customer identification
- Clear jobs-to-be-done framework
- Quantified value propositions
