# Problem Understanding Refinement Task

## Objective
Refine the original problem understanding in the PID based on insights from the comprehensive research and data analysis phases.

## Agents Involved
- **Product Manager**: Leads refinement process and ensures strategic alignment with business goals
- **Jobs-to-be-Done Expert**: Ensures refined problem statement accurately reflects user jobs and desired outcomes
- **Data Analyst**: Provides supporting evidence and confidence levels for refinement decisions
- **Qualitative Research Specialist**: Contributes user insights and behavioral understanding
- **Quantitative Research Agent**: Provides statistical backing and market validation

## Key Activities

### Problem Statement Refinement
- **Original vs. Refined Comparison**: Document evolution from original to refined understanding
- **User/Customer Clarity**: Clearly define and distinguish users vs. customers based on research findings
- **Job-to-be-Done Articulation**: Refine understanding of the core job users are trying to accomplish
- **Value Proposition Refinement**: Update value proposition based on research insights
- **Context Enhancement**: Improve understanding of service blueprint and ecosystem context

### Evidence-Based Updates
- **Assumption Validation**: Update or remove assumptions based on research findings
- **Insight Integration**: Incorporate key insights from data analysis into problem definition
- **Confidence Levels**: Document confidence levels for different aspects of refined understanding
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Identify any remaining gaps and assess acceptable risk levels

### Success Metrics Definition
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Define specific, measurable indicators of successful job completion
- **Leading Indicators**: Identify early signals that the job is being completed successfully
- **Lagging Indicators**: Define ultimate success measures for the user's job-to-be-done
- **Baseline Establishment**: Set current state baselines where possible

### Competitive Context Refinement
- **Solution Landscape**: Update understanding of how users currently solve their jobs
- **Competitive Gaps**: Identify specific gaps in existing solutions
- **Opportunity Sizing**: Refine market opportunity assessment based on research
- **Differentiation Potential**: Highlight potential areas for competitive advantage

### Service Blueprint Integration
- **Ecosystem Impact**: Understand how refined problem fits within broader service ecosystem
- **Touchpoint Analysis**: Identify key service touchpoints relevant to the job-to-be-done
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Map all stakeholders affected by or influencing the problem

## Deliverables
- Refined problem statement with evidence-based updates
- User/customer definition with clear distinctions and characteristics
- Jobs-to-be-done framework with validated user jobs and desired outcomes
- Success metrics framework with leading and lagging indicators
