# Gap Analysis Task

## Objective

Analyze the provided PID problem statement and identify assumptions and
knowledge gaps that need to be filled for a comprehensive problem understanding.

## Agents Involved

- **Product Manager**: Orchestrates the gap analysis process and validates
  completeness
- **Qualitative Research Specialist**: Identifies gaps requiring qualitative
  research approaches
- **Desk Research Agent**: Identifies gaps that can be filled through desk
  research
- **Jobs-to-be-Done Expert**: Identifies gaps in understanding user jobs and
  needs

## Key Activities

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**
    - Review the current problem statement in PID
    - Identify explicit and implicit assumptions
    - Map out what we know vs. what we assume

2. **Gap Identification Framework**
    - **User/Customer Understanding**: Who is the user vs. customer (if
      different)?
    - **Job-to-be-Done**: What job is the user trying to accomplish? How is 
      it helping them be a better version of themselves?
    - **Value Proposition**: What specific value does solving this create?
    - **Competitive Landscape**: How do users currently solve this job? 
      Which tools do they use? How satisfied are they with their current
      solutions? How important is this job-to-be-done to them?
    - **Success Metrics**: How would we measure successful job completion?
    - **Service Blueprint Context**: How does this fit within broader service
      ecosystem?

3. **Gap Documentation**
    - Create a structured list of identified gaps
    - Categorize gaps by type (user research, market research) and the 
      remediation action (qualitative, quantitative, desk research)
    - Note current assumptions for each gap
    - Assess the potential impact of each gap on problem understanding

## Deliverables

- Gap analysis report with categorized knowledge gaps
- Assumption mapping document
- Initial assessment of gap criticality for problem understanding

## Success Criteria

- All major assumptions are explicitly identified
- Knowledge gaps are clearly articulated and categorized
- Foundation is set for prioritization in the next task
- Uses crewai flows to orchestrate the tasks
- only agents and tasks contributing to this task are left, all other agents are
  removed
