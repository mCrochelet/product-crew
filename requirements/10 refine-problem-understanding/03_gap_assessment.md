# Gap Assessment Task

## Objective
Analyze the prioritized knowledge gaps and select the ones we MUST fill to feel comfortable proceeding with problem understanding, leveraging product manager expertise for final decisions.

## Agents Involved
- **Product Manager**: Makes final assessment decisions based on product strategy and risk tolerance
- **Jobs-to-be-Done Expert**: Assesses criticality of job-related gaps for user understanding
- **Data Analyst**: Evaluates data requirements and availability for decision-making

## Key Activities
1. **Critical Gap Assessment**
   - Review prioritized gap list from previous task
   - Apply "must have" vs. "nice to have" framework
   - Consider minimum viable understanding threshold
   - Assess risk of proceeding without each gap filled

2. **Product Manager Decision Framework**
   - **Strategic Alignment**: Does this gap affect core product decisions?
   - **Risk Mitigation**: What's the cost of being wrong about this assumption?
   - **Resource Constraints**: What can we realistically research given time/budget?
   - **Decision Timing**: When do we need this information for product decisions?

3. **Final Gap Selection**
   - Select critical gaps that MUST be filled
   - Document rationale for inclusion/exclusion decisions
   - Set confidence thresholds for proceeding
   - Define "good enough" criteria for each selected gap

4. **Quality Gates**
   - Define what constitutes sufficient evidence for each gap
   - Set research success criteria
   - Plan decision checkpoints during research phase

## Deliverables
- Final list of critical gaps requiring research
- Decision rationale document with risk assessment
- Quality gates and success criteria for each selected gap
- Resource allocation recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Clear, defensible selection of critical knowledge gaps
- Product manager sign-off on gap selection and research scope
- Foundation set for targeted research plan creation
