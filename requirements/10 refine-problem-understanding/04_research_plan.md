# Research Plan Creation Task

## Objective
Create a comprehensive research plan to fill the identified critical knowledge gaps through a series of research phases, with preference for desk research when likely to yield valuable data.

## Agents Involved
- **Product Manager**: Validates research plan alignment with business needs and timeline
- **Qualitative Research Specialist**: Designs qualitative research phases and methodologies
- **Quantitative Research Agent**: Designs quantitative research phases with proper statistical approach
- **Desk Research Agent**: Identifies desk research opportunities and designs search strategies
- **Jobs-to-be-Done Expert**: Ensures research questions align with JTBD methodology

## Key Activities
1. **Research Phase Sequencing**
   - Map critical gaps to appropriate research methodologies
   - Sequence research phases for optimal learning (desk → qualitative → quantitative)
   - Identify dependencies between research phases
   - Plan decision checkpoints throughout research process

2. **Research Methodology Selection**
   - **Desk Research**: For competitive analysis, market data, existing studies
   - **Qualitative Research**: For user behavior, motivations, jobs-to-be-done insights
   - **Quantitative Research**: For market sizing, validation, statistical significance
   - **Mixed Methods**: For complex gaps requiring multiple data sources

3. **Research Phase Design**
   - Define research questions for each phase
   - Specify data collection methods and tools
   - Set sample sizes and target participants (where applicable)
   - Estimate timeline and resource requirements
   - Plan data synthesis between phases

4. **Desk Research Prioritization**
   - Identify gaps that existing research/data can address
   - Plan comprehensive desk research strategy first
   - Use desk research findings to refine subsequent primary research
   - Minimize costly primary research where secondary data suffices

## Deliverables
- Multi-phase research plan with timeline and resource requirements
- Detailed research questions for each phase
- Methodology specifications for each research type
- Decision tree for progressing between research phases
- Budget and resource allocation plan

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive plan covering all critical gaps from gap assessment
- Preference for desk research where feasible and valuable
- Clear methodology rationale for each research phase
- Realistic timeline and resource estimates
