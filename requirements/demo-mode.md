# Problem to solve

As a developer, I want to demo how the crew interacts to arrive to the best 
option. 
I want to have control over the speed of the interaction by using a keyboard 
input to move from one "step" to another.

# Acceptance criteria
I can provide a CLI argument to start the demo mode: `--demo`
The argument is optional.
