# Task 1: Project Setup and Dependencies

## Objective
Set up the Python project structure and install required dependencies for the product-crew CLI application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a new Python project with proper structure
- [ ] Set up Python 3.13 environment
- [ ] Install CrewAI dependency
- [ ] Install click or argparse for CLI argument parsing
- [ ] Create requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with dependencies
- [ ] Set up entry point for the `product-crew` command
- [ ] Verify the command can be executed (even if it does nothing yet)

## Implementation Details
- Use a virtual environment for Python 3.13
- Choose appropriate CLI library (click recommended for easier argument parsing)
- Ensure the project can be installed/run as `product-crew` command
- Include any additional dependencies needed for file operations and date handling

## Definition of Done
- Virtual environment is set up with Python 3.13
- All required dependencies are installed and documented
- The `product-crew` command is available and can be invoked
- Project structure is ready for implementation
