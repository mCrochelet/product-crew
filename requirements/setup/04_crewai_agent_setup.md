# Task 4: CrewAI Agent Setup

## Objective
Create a simple CrewAI agent that prints the validated paths as raw strings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initialize CrewAI framework
- [ ] Create a simple agent that accepts the requirements and PID paths
- [ ] Agent prints the paths provided as arguments as raw strings
- [ ] Agent execution is triggered after successful validation
- [ ] Handle any CrewAI setup or execution errors gracefully

## Implementation Details
- Import and initialize CrewAI components
- Create a basic agent with a simple task to print the paths
- Pass the validated requirements path and PID path to the agent
- Ensure output is exactly the raw string paths (no additional formatting)
- The agent should be the minimal implementation needed to meet requirements

## Output Format
The agent should print something like:
```
/path/to/requirements
/path/to/pid.md
```

## Definition of Done
- CrewAI is properly initialized and configured
- Agent successfully receives the validated paths
- Agent prints the paths as raw strings to stdout
- No additional formatting or processing of the paths
- Agent execution completes successfully after printing
