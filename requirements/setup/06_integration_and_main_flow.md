# Task 6: Integration and Main Application Flow

## Objective
Integrate all components into a cohesive main application flow that orchestrates the entire process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main function orchestrates the complete workflow
- [ ] Parse CLI arguments → Validate inputs → Run CrewAI agent → Handle file operations
- [ ] Proper error handling at each step
- [ ] Clean exit codes (0 for success, -1 for validation errors)
- [ ] All components work together seamlessly
- [ ] Application handles edge cases and errors gracefully

## Implementation Details
- Create main entry point function that calls all components in order
- Implement proper exception handling for each step
- Ensure the CrewAI agent runs after validation but before file operations
- Use try-catch blocks to handle and report errors appropriately
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between components

## Workflow
1. Parse command-line arguments
2. Validate requirements and PID paths  
3. Run CrewAI agent to print paths
4. Handle file creation/overwriting based on flag
5. Exit with appropriate status code

## Definition of Done
- Complete end-to-end workflow functions correctly
- All error scenarios are handled with appropriate exit codes
- Success path completes all steps in correct order
- Application is ready for testing and deployment
- Code is clean and maintainable
