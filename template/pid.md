# Product initiative document (PID) template

## Problem Space

ðŸ’¡ The goal of this section is to help you understand why this is a problem and
why we have to solve it now.
Don't mention any solution or feature, rather describe the problems or the
frustration behind it. Who do you solve the problem for?
Use data & insights to illustrate your problem. If you do not have data or
insights about it, then this is probably not the right problem to solve.
This is an iterative process; you will have to reformulate your problems until
they are understandable and properly backed up by data.
In a nutshell, if you still have doubts that this is the right problem to solve,
you need to keep on refining it.

### Problem to solve 1 (one PID can have multiple problems to solve)

What problem are we solving? For whom? When do they experience this issue? Why
is solving this problem urgent? Why is it important?

## Research summary

Write down or link the reports with the takeaways and formulate conclusions
of your research

## Solution Space

The second part describes the solution thoroughly and helps to understand how
you intend to solve the problem.

### Vision

ðŸ’¡ This short part should be the conclusion of your analysis. It should provide
the scope of the initiative and be your guiding principle when doing your
solution design.

Summarize how you intend to solve the problem and to connect your initiative to
the product vision.

### Strategic Goal & Success Metrics

ðŸ’¡ What is the strategic fit and why is it important to our users and our
business to solve this problem? What will be the metrics to measure the success
and why?
You need to connect your initiative with your product strategy and your OKRs. If
you canâ€™t link it with your current strategic goals, then maybe itâ€™s not a
problem to solve now. If your organization does not have strategic goals, make
sure your team does.

### High-Level Approach

ðŸ’¡ Describe briefly the approach you're taking to solve the problem. From a
high-level perspective, what will be the different steps of the initiative? Do
not remain focused solely on delivery. Any necessary action should be mentioned.
This could help key stakeholders understand their role in the success of this
initiative. Avoid mentioning dates to avoid bold commitments as it will be too
soon to position yourself.

#### Step 1

Describe the first step you're taking to solve the problem.

#### Step 2

Describe the second step you're taking to solve the problem.

#### Step 3

Describe the third step you're taking to solve the problem.

### Risks to Mitigate
