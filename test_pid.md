# Problem to solve

Define a distinctive value proposition so that we (engie) attract more of
the nestleaver customer profile.

# Segment

Younger audience: age between 23 – 30 years;
Often this is the first time they live alone or in couple (we sometimes refer to
them as “nestleavers”);
They are mainly renters, not house owners;
They have a more limited spending budget;
Climate change is an important topic to them.
They typically have an energy profile that corresponds with the full-time job
population. As in our business, energy profile (when and how much they consume)
is becoming more and more relevant, it can be an aspect to take in consideration
when reflecting on a VP specific for this population – for example: do they
possess an EV, and if so, can they charge at home?
From research (via interviews) we have learned that many look to their parents
for advice in where to go for their first energy contract. They are obviously
very digital minded, and very active on social media. However, they indicate a
preference to make use of traditional contact channels (website, call-centre)
when their need is contract related.

## Core Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### Households (B2C)

1. **“Keep my home powered with no bill shocks.”**
   Offers fixed, variable, and **dynamic** tariffs; app-led usage
   insights. ([The Brussels Times][8], [ENGIE.be][9])
2. **“Go green without hassle.”**
   Solar + batteries for homes/SMEs (via ENGIE Solutions and
   Sun4Business). ([ENGIE Business][10], [pv magazine International][11])
3. **“Charge my EV, at home and on the road.”**
   Design, install, and manage charging; roaming access to large public
   networks. ([ENGIE Business][12])

### Businesses & Public Sector (B2B/B2G)

1. **“Secure, predictable energy for my sites.”**
   Asset-backed supply, hedging, and risk management via GEMS; corporate
   PPAs. ([gems.engie.com][13], [Tamarindo][14], [corporate.engie.be][15])
2. **“Hit decarbonization targets.”**
   On-site solar, storage, CHP, efficiency projects; long-term green PPAs (e.g.,
   Google, Umicore). ([Tamarindo][14], [corporate.engie.be][15])
3. **“Electrify fleets and operations.”**
   Full-stack EV charging, load management, and service
   SLAs. ([ENGIE Business][12])
4. **“Stay resilient and flexible.”**
   Capacity and balancing backed by **nuclear LTO**, new **CCGT Flémalle**, and
   grid-scale **BESS**. ([Reuters][2], [Tractebel][3], [Energy Storage][4])

---

## Value Proposition by Segment

* **B2C:** Reliable supply + tariff choice (incl. **dynamic**) + simple paths to
  rooftop PV and EV charging. One brand, one app, broad
  support. ([ENGIE.be][9], [ENGIE Business][10])
* **SME/Mid-market:** Funded solar and storage (PPA/TPF), audits, and
  demand-side control to cut bills and CO₂. ([ENGIE Business][16])
* **Large enterprise/industry:** Bankable **PPAs**, asset-backed hedging, 24/7
  operations support, and decarb road-mapping through
  GEMS. ([gems.engie.com][13])
* **System partner:** Keeps lights on with dispatchable capacity (nuclear, CCGT)
  and flexibility (BESS), reducing price spikes and adequacy
  risk. ([Reuters][2], [Tractebel][3], [Energy Storage][4])

## Competitive Positioning (Belgium)

### Market power today

* **Brussels (electricity, access points):** ENGIE \~**71%**; TotalEnergies *
  *15.3%**; Luminus **6.2%**.&#x20;
* **Wallonia (electricity, access points):** ENGIE **46%**; Luminus **24%**;
  TotalEnergies **10%**; Eneco **8%**; Mega **6%**.&#x20;
* **Flanders (electricity):** ENGIE **\~39.2%**; Luminus **\~23.2%**; Eneco *
  *\~12.4%** (VREG).&#x20;

### Head-to-head set

* **Luminus (EDF):** Strong in green branding and services; #2 share.
* **Eneco:** Green-led challenger; strong in wind-backed offers.
* **TotalEnergies:** Growing retail base; building storage (50 MW/150 MWh across
  Antwerp/Feluy). ([The Wall Street Journal][17])
* **Digital price fighters:** **Mega**, **Energie.be**, **Elegant** win
  price-sensitive churn; gaining share in Flanders.&#x20;
* **Co-ops / niche green:** **Ecopower**, **Bolt** appeal on
  community/traceability (smaller scale).

### ENGIE’s differentiators

* **Security of supply moat.** Only player with **extended nuclear** + **new
  CCGT** + **CRM-backed BESS** in one stack. Hard to
  copy. ([Reuters][2], [Tractebel][3], [Energy Storage][4])
* **End-to-end decarbonization.** From **PPAs** to on-site assets and EV; proven
  with blue-chip deals (Google,
  Umicore). ([Tamarindo][14], [corporate.engie.be][15])
* **Scale + brand reach.** \~**3 m** customers; deepest presence in Brussels;
  strong cross-sell into services. ([Reuters][5])

### Where rivals can win

* **Pure-play green narrative** (Eneco, co-ops) when nuclear acceptance is low.
* **Lower-cost, digital-only supply** (Mega/Energie.be) in switching waves.
* **Niche enterprise storage/solar specialists** can out-execute on single-site
  projects.

---

## Risks & Watch-outs

* **Policy & state-aid constraints.** Nuclear LTO depends on EU/state terms;
  approved in Feb 2025, but oversight continues. ([Reuters][2])
* **Price competition.** VREG shows big three losing share to smaller suppliers
  in 2024–25. ([VREG][18])
* **Execution on flexibility.** Timely delivery of **Flémalle** and **Kallo BESS
  ** is critical to the adequacy story. ([Tractebel][3], [Energy Storage][4])

---

## What this means for JTBD fit

* **Best fit** when the job needs **reliability + decarb + one-throat-to-choke.
  **
  Examples: multi-site PPAs, fleet electrification, funded rooftop PV with O\&M,
  24/7 supply backed by
  nuclear/CCGT/BESS. ([Reuters][5], [Tractebel][3], [Energy Storage][4])
* **Competitive pressure** when the job is **“just the cheapest kWh.”**
  Digital challengers can undercut; ENGIE must prove **TCO** via efficiency,
  load-shifting, and service bundling.&#x20;

---

## Quick proof points (Belgium)

* Nuclear life-extension (Doel 4, Tihange 3) approved; waste-liability mechanism
  agreed. ([Reuters][2])
* **Flémalle 875 MW** CCGT first-fire; COD planned **Nov 2025
  **. ([Tractebel][3])
* **Kallo 100 MW/400 MWh** BESS under CRM; construction
  advancing. ([Energy Storage][4])
* Corporate PPAs with **Google** (118 MW) and **Umicore** (on/offshore
  wind). ([Tamarindo][14], [corporate.engie.be][15])

### Bottom line

ENGIE Belgium is the **incumbent system-maker**: biggest supplier, unique asset
stack, and a full decarbonization shop. It wins when the job is **secure, green,
and easy**—not just **cheap**.
