# Product crew

The product crew is a team of agents acting as a senior product trio to
discovery, research and design
product initiative documents.
The team is composed of:

- A product manager: acting as the overall product lead, the product manager is
  responsible for discovering areas of opportunity for the customer and users,
  and can frame them in actionable product areas. Ultimately, the product
  manager is responsible for the value and viability of the product.
- An engineering manager: acting as the technical lead, the engineering manager
  is responsible for evaluating and design solutions that will be feasible and
  cost-effective.
- A product designer: acting as the visual lead, the product designer is
  responsible for creating an experience that is intuitively usable.
- A functional analyst: acting as the right-hand of the product and engineering
  manager, the functional analyst is responsible for the breakdown of the
  solution into functional increments (tasks).
- A scrum master: acting as the process guardian, the scrum master is
  responsible for the team velocity and ensures that each initiative document is
  broken down into manageable tasks
- A market analyst: the market analyst is responsible for market research and is
  able to deeply analyse the available information through desk research. It
  also knows when data is missing and how to acquire it (e.g., qualitative
  research, interviews, surveys, etc.)

## Problem Space

ðŸ’¡ The goal of this section is to help you understand why this is a problem and
why we have to solve it now.
Don't mention any solution or feature, rather describe the problems or the
frustration behind it. Who do you solve the problem for?
Use data & insights to illustrate your problem. If you do not have data or
insights about it, then this is probably not the right problem to solve.
This is an iterative process; you will have to reformulate your problems until
they are understandable and properly backed up by data.
In a nutshell, if you still have doubts that this is the right problem to solve,
you need to keep on refining it.

### Problem to solve 1 (one PID can have multiple problems to solve)

What problem are we solving? For whom? When do they experience this issue? Why
is solving this problem urgent? Why is it important?

## Research summary

Write down or link the reports with the takeaways and formulate conclusions
of your research

## Solution Space

The second part describes the solution thoroughly and helps to understand how
you intend to solve the problem.

### Vision

ðŸ’¡ This short part should be the conclusion of your analysis. It should provide
the scope of the initiative and be your guiding principle when doing your
solution design.

Summarize how you intend to solve the problem and to connect your initiative to
the product vision.

### Strategic Goal & Success Metrics

ðŸ’¡ What is the strategic fit and why is it important to our users and our
business to solve this problem? What will be the metrics to measure the success
and why?
You need to connect your initiative with your product strategy and your OKRs. If
you canâ€™t link it with your current strategic goals, then maybe itâ€™s not a
problem to solve now. If your organization does not have strategic goals, make
sure your team does.

### High-Level Approach

ðŸ’¡ Describe briefly the approach you're taking to solve the problem. From a
high-level perspective, what will be the different steps of the initiative? Do
not remain focused solely on delivery. Any necessary action should be mentioned.
This could help key stakeholders understand their role in the success of this
initiative. Avoid mentioning dates to avoid bold commitments as it will be too
soon to position yourself.

#### Step 1

Describe the first step you're taking to solve the problem.

#### Step 2

Describe the second step you're taking to solve the problem.

#### Step 3

Describe the third step you're taking to solve the problem.

### Risks to Mitigate

ðŸ’¡ Risks or unknowns to get resolved or monitored closely. Potential dependencies
with other teams or service providers. To make sure youâ€™ve done your risk
assessment properly,
use [the four big risks framework from Marty Cagan.](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/)

#### Value risk

Whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it

#### Usability risk

Whether users can figure out how to use it

#### Feasibility risk

Whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills, and
technology we have

#### Business viability risk

Whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business

### User Flows

Describe the user flows you're taking to solve the problem.
